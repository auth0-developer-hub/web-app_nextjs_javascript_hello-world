This JavaScript code sample demonstrates how to build web applications using Next.js and React. This Next.js code sample uses the App Router.

Visit the ["Next.js/JavaScript Code Samples: App Security in Action"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/web-app/nextjs-javascript) section of the ["Auth0 Developer Resources"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources) to explore how you can secure Next.js applications written in JavaScript by implementing user authentication with Auth0.

## Why Use Auth0?

Auth0 is a flexible drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Your team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize users. We offer tons of guidance and SDKs for you to get started and [integrate Auth0 into your stack easily](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/full-stack).

## Set Up and Run the Next.js Project
